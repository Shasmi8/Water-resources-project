<ol>
<li>Under ground water - Aforestation:
        <ul type=square>
        <li>Forest and other vegetation cover slow the surface runoff and replenish underground water.
        </ul>
<li>Water harvesting:
        <ul type=square>
        <li>Water harvesting is another method to save surface runoff.
        </ul>
<li> Canal:
        <ul type=square>
        <li> The canals used for irrigation fields should be properly lined to minimize losses by water seepage.
        </ul>
<li>Sprinkler system:
        <ul type=square>
        <li>Sprinklers effectively irrigate the are by checking water losses through seepage and evaporation.
        </ul>
<li>Drip and trickle irrigation:
        <ul type=square>
        <li> In dry regions with hight rates of evaporation, drip or trickle irrigation is very useful. The valuable water resource can therefore be conserved by adopting these means of irrigation .
        </ul>
