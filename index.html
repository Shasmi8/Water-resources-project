<p>Water is an important renewable natural resource.Earth is called as the water planet as three-fourths-71% of the earth is covered with water and the remaining 21% is covered with land.Ocean water covers the two-third of the earth but it is not fit for human consumption as it is saline.Only 2.7% of water is fresh but nearly 70% of this occurs in ice sheets and glaciers.Due to their location these are inaccessible. So,only 1% of fresh water is fit for human use and is available easily.These are found as ground water,surface water in lakes and rivers and as water vapour in atmosphere.Hence,fresh water is the most precious thing on earth.The total volume of water always remains constant,it cannot be added or subracted.But it seems to vary becuase of its constant motion as water cycle.Water cycle (Hydrologic cycle) is a process of continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. </p>
